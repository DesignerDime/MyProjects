						<p><strong>ENDOMORPH BODY TYPE</strong>
						Endomorphs have a thicker build, and they are often called thick, short, and stocky. 
						An endomorph body type has a naturally slower metabolism, making it easy for them to get bigger or bulk, 
						but when cutting season comes around, they struggle. Endomorphs typically focus on fat loss.</p>

						<p><strong>ECTOMORPH BODY TYPE</strong>
						On the opposite side of the spectrum, an ectomorph body type is lean, skinny, or lanky. They are often called hardgainers. 
						They have a naturally high metabolic rate, allowing them to eat all day and not gain a pound. They can quickly lose weight, 
						but always have trouble with bulking up or putting on weight. Ectomorphs often focus on getting bigger.</p>

						<p><strong>MESOMORPH BODY TYPE</strong>
						The mesomorph body type is the one we all want to have. They have a naturally lean and muscular physique, 
						and are often called athletic or sporty. They have a higher metabolic rate that allows them to stay lean, 
						but not so high that it doesnâ€™t allow them to pack on muscle size. They can gain muscle as easily as they can burn fat.
						 Some mesomorphs have weak points such as small calves, but this will differ from person to person.</p>
